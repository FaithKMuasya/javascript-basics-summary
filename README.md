# JavaScript Basics Summary

This document summarizes key foundational concepts in JavaScript. It is intended as a reference for beginners learning the language.

## Variables

Variables are used to store data values.

- **Declaration**: The process of creating a variable (e.g., using `var`, `let`, or `const`).
- **Assignment**: Giving a value to a variable after or during declaration.
- **Types of Variables**:
  - `var`: Function-scoped, can be re-declared and updated.
  - `let`: Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
  - `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared.

## Variable Scope

Scope defines where variables can be accessed.

- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function or block, accessible everywhere.
- **Function Scope**: Variables declared with `var` inside a function, only accessible within that function.
- **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block (`{}`), only accessible within that block.

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task.

- **Function Declaration**: A named function defined using the `function` keyword.
- **Function Expression**: A function assigned to a variable.
- **Arrow Functions**: A shorter syntax for writing functions.

---

## Parameters and Arguments

- **Parameters**: Variables listed in the function definition.
- **Arguments**: Values passed to the function when it is called.

---

## Return Values

- A function can return a value using the `return` keyword.
- Once `return` is executed, the function stops and the returned value is sent back to the caller.

---

## Conditionals

Conditionals control the flow of code based on certain conditions.

- `if`: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
- `else`: Executes if the `if` condition is false.
- `else if`: Checks additional conditions if the previous `if` was false.
- `switch`: A cleaner alternative for multiple `if-else` conditions.
